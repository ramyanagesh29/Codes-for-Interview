1.Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
The input is generated such that a majority element will exist in the array.
Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

Solution:

class Solution{
public int majorityElement(int[] nums){
int candidate=0;
int count=0;
int n=nums.length;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
if(count==0){
candidate=nums[i];
}
if(nums[i]==candidate){
count++;
}
else{
count--;
}
}
return candidate;
}
}

2.189. Rotate Array

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
